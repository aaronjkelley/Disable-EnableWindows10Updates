# Disable-EnableWindows10Updates
DISCLAIMER: THIS IS MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR WINDOWS 10 USERS (NOT ON WINDOWS PRO OR HIGHER) THAT DO NOT HAVE 
THE OPTION TO DEFER UPGRADES AND TURN OFF UPDATES. THESE FILES WILL, IN NO WAY, HARM YOUR SYSTEM. HOWEVER,
KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS FULLY DISABLES THE UPDATE SERVICE, SO YOU WILL NOT GET RECOMMENDED SECURITY UPDATES ON YOUR PC.
I FULLY SUGGEST TO PERIODICALLY USE THE "ENABLE" BATCH FILE SO YOU MAY GO TO WINDOWS UPDATE AND INSTALL ANY NEEDED UPDATES
DURING PERIODIC WEEKS THAT YOU PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

***2 separate batch files that will disable and then re-enable Windows update service**

HOW DO I USE THIS? GLAD YOU ASKED...
You must download the .bat files to your desktop (or anywhere else on your PC). To run them, you right click, select "Run As Administrator".
The prompt will flash a screen and go away. If there is no error, then disabling the service has worked properly. If you want to re-enable
the update service, you must run "Enable" batch file in the same manor, with "Run As Administrator". 
See below.

The files are listed as follows (screen shots give example as well)...
      "DisableWindowsUpdate.bat" - this will disable Windows update service so you will not get that dreaded "installing updates" screen.
      "EnableWindowsUpdate.bat" - this will RE-Enable Windows update service so you can proceed with updates as needed.
